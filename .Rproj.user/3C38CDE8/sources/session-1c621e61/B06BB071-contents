## Introduction

This is a basic model covering single lab with no offsets in place. Our aim is to check that we get the correct estimates based on the data provided. 

```{r}
## Load packages

library(tidyverse)
library(rjags)

```


```{r}
## Get the data
f1l_sc1_url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pete-jacobsson/fake_lab/main/fake1_scenario1.csv" 
f1l_sc1 <- read_csv(url(f1l_sc1_url))

```
