## Introduction

This is a basic model covering single lab with no offsets in place. Our aim is to check that we get the correct estimates based on the data provided. 

```{r}
## Load packages

library(tidyverse)
library(rjags)

```


```{r}
## Get the data
fl1_sc1_url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pete-jacobsson/fake_lab/main/fake1_scenario1.csv" 
fl1_sc1 <- read_csv(url(fl1_sc1_url))

```

### Now set up the model

```{r}
n_total <- nrow(fl1_sc1)
n_instruments <- length(unique(fl1_sc1$instrument))
n_operators <- length(unique(fl1_sc1$operator))

measurement_mean <- mean(fl1_sc1$measurement)
measurement_sd <- sd(fl1_sc1$measurement)

```

### Prepare stuff for going into JAGS
```{r}
data_list <- list(
  measurement <- fl1_sc1$measurement,
  instrument <- fl1_sc1$instrument,
  operator <- fl1_sc1$operator,
  n_total <- n_total,
  n_instruments <- n_instruments,
  n_operators <- n_operators,
  measurement_mean <- measurement_mean,
  measurement_sd <- measurement_sd
)
```
