# bayes_comparisons
 A project exploring the use of Bayesian hierarchical models to run lab comparisons


## Introduction
This project covers determining magnitude of biases and excess variability in simulated laboratory contexts by using Bayesian multilevel models, Following Kruschke (2015). I hope to update the tech at some point to using tidier approaches.


## Methodology



## How to use the code
